# Hey, welcome on my GitHub!
I'm a half-time developer who can't focus on a single project, so I'm constantly switching from project to project. My main projects are [Sasaki](https://sasaki.me), [AnimeRose](https://animerose.de) and the [Kawaii API](https://kawaii.red). These are all Discord focused and mainly coded in Python. If you want to read more than just a few short sentences from me you are welcome to have a look at my [private website](https://error44.dev). 

### Some statistics about me and my activity on GitHub:

### Some repositories from the [Kawaii API](https://kawaii.red):
The Kawaii API is a random GIF API created specifically for Discord bots with roleplay commands. These GIFs are all handpicked to avoid errors like wrong GIFs or other things. It is free to use like all my projects.
