    <h2 align='center'>About Me</h2>
    <p align='center'><span>I am a german half time programmer who is mainly specialized in entertainment programs, systems and servers. So I am mainly active in the area of Discord bot programming, creation of websites and APIs which I host all on my own managed server. I also organize game server events for my own Discord server but also for other people and communities. I do all of this in my spare time and continue to learn as I go, so I change from project to project and don't really have a point where I say this is perfect and it stays that way. There is always something that can be done better and I try to pursue that as best as possible.</span></p>
